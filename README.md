# Reverse-Matchmove-GAN
The goal of this project is to be able to reverse engineer new camera views from existing footage. This is the same network from my blog post: http://neuralvfx.com/matchmove/reverse-matchmove-gan/

My dataset was created by photographing many random angles of a statue in Chiang Mai, and then using a photo-modeling tool to extract camera positions and create a Matrix-Image pair. I'll be posting this dataset online soon!

# Code Usage

*This repo is still being buit and tested, I will update the Usage when complete*
